 Hello, myself is Alexander Smith. I am a first year MBA student here at IIM Lucknow.  I come from a suburban part of India. I did my B.Tech in Agriculture Engineering, my M.Tech in Food Process Engineering.  During my M.Tech I co-founded an Agritech startup. I ran it for 10 months and generated around 1,000 surplus revenue.  Lastly, I was working in an Agritech farm. I was leading a project on the application of remote sensing IoT and artificial intelligence in the field of agriculture and allied sectors.  I am passionate about entrepreneurship and I am always interested in working in new challenging areas, mainly in the business development and strategy domain.  As I am besides you, concentrated on the fact that the online communication is turning like a black box lately and understanding those facial expressions behind the camera is getting harder and harder day by day.  So, having a deep learning algorithm that can analyze the facial expressions and provide a result that is more than 95% accurate will definitely help the civil society for a better human resource development and to maintain a better mental health graph.  As we know that the coming age is going to be the age of artificial intelligence and to be a part of such a noble cause where the artificial intelligence is the backbone will definitely motivate someone like me  who is always interested in working in the challenging areas, mainly where the artificial intelligence is the backbone for the development of the society. Thank you.
