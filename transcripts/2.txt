 Hello, I am Beside You. I am Cameron Barajas and I am thrilled to apply to this opportunity  today. I recently completed my BBA in 2022. I have a flexible attitude. I can lead the  team and be a good team player according to the situation. I am a passionate individual  who aims for perfection in the task and I always try to give my best and reach the expectations.  In summer 2022, I interned in a boutique investment bank based out of Hyderabad. In this internship,  I worked closely with senior professionals. I was involved in developing the framework  of a venture network at the ideation stage. This venture network focused on providing  funds at the seed level and CD sale levels. I got an opportunity to discuss about startups  and what an investor should look for before investing in a startup. And I found this whole  process exciting. In addition to this, I interned with a startup known as Kabadi Techno. And  in this internship, I regularly discussed the growth of the startups and how a business  should be working with the founder. And I used to update my business model accordingly  according to our discussions. And my area of focus in this internship was on finance.  So I prepared the financial model to get a ballpark figure valuation of the startup.  So these two latest internships have provided me a comprehensive view of the company's perspective  and an investor's perspective. So now I am looking for a challenging role where I can  put my all skills to practice and grow at an acceleration rate. And this is what I am  Beside You is providing. Hence, I firmly believe that I am Beside You and I am a perfect fit.  Thank you.
