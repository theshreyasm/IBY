 Hello, I am Joseph Nichols. I belong to the heritage city of Varanasi. I have done my undergraduation  in earth science from Banaras Hindu University. And post that I have worked with the single  largest government owned reinsurer in the country called General Insurance Corporation  of India in their retrocession and reinsurance underwriting departments. My thorough understanding  of the Indian markets and analytical skills acquired due to working in such a diverse  and rich field such as reinsurance, along with my verbal and written communication skills  are the attributes which I feel make me the right fit for this job. As a person I believe  in the thought that you cannot find newer oceans until you lose sight of the shore.  This thought is something that pushes me each day towards having newer experiences.  While reading about your company and beside you, I understood that you guys want to create a  society where children can live their lives as they are and realize the uniqueness of each person  through artificial intelligence. This idea really resonated with me and I do wish to be a part of  this awakening. Thank you so much.
