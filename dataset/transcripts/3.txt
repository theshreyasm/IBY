 My name is Michael Guzman and I am 21 years old.  Hailing from a small family in Varanasi, I had been there most of my life, but MBA has  given me the experience of living alone for the first time, which has been quite tough  and challenging for me.  I completed my school being one of the top students of my batch and also being a part  of the school student council as the activity head of the school.  Later on, I gave the undergraduate entrance exam of BHU securing a rank in the top 1.2%  and pursued to become honours from Varanasi University, but unfortunately, due to COVID-19,  most of my college life was spent online.  During my very day days when I had the opportunity to put my foot in the college, I volunteered  as a member of the National Service Team, working towards the welfare of the society  through small yet powerful steps.  During lockdown, I helped in spreading awareness regarding COVID-19 being a part of an event  organising committee of my college.  I had an internship in a small steel manufacturing firm related to steel furniture in Varanasi  as a sales associate to get some practical experience.  I also interned in an accounting firm to gain knowledge and learn about the practical applications  of accounting in the real world.  Apart from my academics, I love to confidently say that I am an excellent guitar player and  learned the art of fingerstyle guitar, which at the time was not popular at my place and  hence I had to learn from various sources online myself.  I also run a small YouTube channel devoted to my passion for music and that is where  I upload my own arrangements as well as covers along with tutorials.  I have found that the role offered by your company has sparked interest in me as I believe  it would be a challenging and rewarding experience.  Moving towards the end, I would love to know if I am beside you during the next year's  hours.  Thank you!
