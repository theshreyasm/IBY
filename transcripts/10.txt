 My name is Michael Ramos, I am from Patna, Bihar. I have done my schooling in Commerce and then  I went up to do my graduation in B.Com Honours. I have interned as an Accounting Associate  as well as a Tax Associate wherein I got the chance to apply all the knowledge that I had  learned in my B.Com to apply them in real life scenario. Apart from Academics, I have  been involved in a lot of extracurricular activities. I was the captain of the students  committee in my final school year and was also awarded the Best Student Award at the  end of the year. When I went up to college, I was the class representative which again  is the part of the students committee. Apart from that, I have been a part of Bad Scouts  and Guide for more than 5 years where I have completed several treks and was part of a  lot of activities that were based for social needs and for social cause. In my free time,  I like to read both fiction and non-fiction based on if I am feeling creative that day  or if I want to gain some info. The short term goal for me is to find a job where I  can apply the skill set and the knowledge that I have gained so far and build new skills  alongside. Whereas in the long term, I look for a role wherein I will be able to create  value. I look for bigger targets so that I can test myself. I need to figure myself during  the preliminary years so that when the superior targets are put, I am able to come up with  the best outcomes.
