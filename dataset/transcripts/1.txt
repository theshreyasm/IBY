 Hello, I am Jeffrey Shepherd and I am currently pursuing postgraduate and management from  IIM Coikode. I have completed my B.Tech in Biotechnology from Heritage Institute of  Technology Kolkata, followed by my M.Tech from IIT Kharagpur. I come with an experience  of three years in the regulatory affairs domain of the pharmaceutical industry and I worked  as a medical writer in Ciro Klein Farm, Mumbai and have specialized in drug safety and risk  management. What sets me apart is the expertise I bring in with my three years of experience  and an added two years of postgraduation. Along with this, I add another dimension to  the discussion with my background in biotechnology. An added advantage is my ability to pay attention  to detail, which is well testamented in my research work and patents, publication and  the best research award which my work at IIT Kharagpur has received. After my 12th, I developed  a keen interest in baking and over time this has transitioned from a mere hobby into my  passion. I love experimenting with traditional recipes and regularly bake for family as well  as small functions. I also enjoy traveling, exploring new places, meeting new people and  experiencing different cultures. The core competencies which have helped me in my  professional career are mainly my consistency. I have consistently excelled in my academics  and this perseverance has also helped me grow in my professional career. In addition to this,  my ability to pay attention to minutest of details helps me to view a problem from  various angles and evaluate and analyze it to come to an effective solution. Thank you.
