3. My name is Michael Guzman and I am 21 years old.  Hailing from a small family in Varanasi, I had been there most of my life, but MBA has  given me the experience of living alone for the first time, which has been quite tough  and challenging for me.  I completed my school being one of the top students of my batch and also being a part  of the school student council as the activity head of the school.  Later on, I gave the undergraduate entrance exam of BHU securing a rank in the top 1.2%  and pursued to become honours from Varanasi University, but unfortunately, due to COVID-19,  most of my college life was spent online.  During my very day days when I had the opportunity to put my foot in the college, I volunteered  as a member of the National Service Team, working towards the welfare of the society  through small yet powerful steps.  During lockdown, I helped in spreading awareness regarding COVID-19 being a part of an event  organising committee of my college.  I had an internship in a small steel manufacturing firm related to steel furniture in Varanasi  as a sales associate to get some practical experience.  I also interned in an accounting firm to gain knowledge and learn about the practical applications  of accounting in the real world.  Apart from my academics, I love to confidently say that I am an excellent guitar player and  learned the art of fingerstyle guitar, which at the time was not popular at my place and  hence I had to learn from various sources online myself.  I also run a small YouTube channel devoted to my passion for music and that is where  I upload my own arrangements as well as covers along with tutorials.  I have found that the role offered by your company has sparked interest in me as I believe  it would be a challenging and rewarding experience.  Moving towards the end, I would love to know if I am beside you during the next year's  hours.  Thank you!

5. Hello, I'm Sakshi. I come from Mumbai. I did my undergraduation in mass media  with specialization in advertising. I have completed two  certification courses. One was entrepreneurship course by Turnip and  second one was foundations of management by Google. Apart from that, when I'm not  busy doing college group projects and assignments, I keep myself busy doing  various things like drawing, painting, singing, writing movie reviews on my  personal movie review account on Instagram. I also recently won an  international art competition hosted by the largest science channel on YouTube  called Krezkazad. They have over 19 million followers and it is one of my  biggest proudest achievements. Because I would like to spread  awareness about mental health issues and neurodevelopmental disorders, I have an  idea to share with you all. The idea goes as we get the AI to analyze what works  and what doesn't work for students with neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD  and then coming up with a program or strategy or a plan to help these  students out through specialized programs with maybe teachers who have a certain  teaching style that just works well for kids like these and or  activities that help them stay focused or concentrate better. That's it. Thank you.
6. Hi, my name is Nathan Lewis. I'm a first year MBA analytics student from IIM  Kashipur. From having a consulting experience at Deloitte for three years  after graduating in engineering, I paved my way to an MBA analytics degree to  quench my thirst for exploration into an amalgamation of a world of analytics  strategy and planning. During my time in Deloitte, I worked on end-to-end  validation processes for softwares for pharmaceutical clients. Also, my ongoing  post-graduation in MBA analytics has taken me closer to the field of analytics  in business. To fuel my constant need to take responsibilities, I am a member of  the media and public relations committee of our college. It lets me be a part of  the team who plans to create and apply for a promotion and PR strategies for  the college. I also handle the social media pages of the college. I have been a  content writer and editor for college related activities since graduation. I  love interacting with people and understanding them. The fact that IIM  beside you has a positive attitude towards mental health issues is  really an amazing thing. The company's very idea of trying to understand real  emotions, my increasing affinity towards analytics, my experience in strategizing  as a consultant and my love for learning are the reasons why I want to join this  internship. Thank you!

And post that I have worked with the single  largest government owned reinsurer in the country called General Insurance Corporation  of India in their retrocession and reinsurance underwriting departments. My thorough understanding  of the Indian markets and analytical skills acquired due to working in such a diverse  and rich field such as reinsurance, along with my verbal and written communication skills  are the attributes which I feel make me the right fit for this job. As a person I believe  in the thought that you cannot find newer oceans until you lose sight of the shore.  This thought is something that pushes me each day towards having newer experiences.  While reading about your company and beside you, I understood that you guys want to create a  society where children can live their lives as they are and realize the uniqueness of each person  through artificial intelligence. This idea really resonated with me and I do wish to be a part of  this awakening. Thank you so much.
8. Hi, hope you're doing well. I'm Srivats Biyani. I am a PGP finance student at IIM Co-Ecode.  Now before joining IIM Co-Ecode, what all have I done? I am a chartered accountant and  I've also cleared CFA level 1. I interned with PWC for more than three years, did my  article shift basically from there and I worked in the statutory audit department. After clearing  CA, I worked with ITC limited in the internal audit department for almost 14 months after  which I joined IIM Co-Ecode for the MBA program. Now a little bit about my skills etc. So I  am a very analytical person. I love playing with numbers, you know, data sets, apply all  sorts of statistical tools, try and understand whatever possible outcomes or interpretations  are there from those numbers. I just love the idea about getting into the edtech space.  Education is something which I believe is the base or the source or basically just the  crux of any economy of the whole, not only the nation, of the whole world. If everyone  is educated, I think the whole problem, I think the major problem will be solved. So  this is the reason I am very fascinated about the idea that your company is providing and  I wish I will be able to expand the successful model that you've built in Japan and bring  that to India as well. So that is what I will aim to do if I am given an opportunity  to work with you. Thank you.
9. Hello, myself is Alexander Smith. I am a first year MBA student here at IIM Lucknow.  I come from a suburban part of India. I did my B.Tech in Agriculture Engineering, my M.Tech in Food Process Engineering.  During my M.Tech I co-founded an Agritech startup. I ran it for 10 months and generated around 1,000 surplus revenue.  Lastly, I was working in an Agritech farm. I was leading a project on the application of remote sensing IoT and artificial intelligence in the field of agriculture and allied sectors.  I am passionate about entrepreneurship and I am always interested in working in new challenging areas, mainly in the business development and strategy domain.  As I am besides you, concentrated on the fact that the online communication is turning like a black box lately and understanding those facial expressions behind the camera is getting harder and harder day by day.  So, having a deep learning algorithm that can analyze the facial expressions and provide a result that is more than 95% accurate will definitely help the civil society for a better human resource development and to maintain a better mental health graph.  As we know that the coming age is going to be the age of artificial intelligence and to be a part of such a noble cause where the artificial intelligence is the backbone will definitely motivate someone like me  who is always interested in working in the challenging areas, mainly where the artificial intelligence is the backbone for the development of the society. Thank you.
