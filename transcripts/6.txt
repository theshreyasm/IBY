 Hi, my name is Nathan Lewis. I'm a first year MBA analytics student from IIM  Kashipur. From having a consulting experience at Deloitte for three years  after graduating in engineering, I paved my way to an MBA analytics degree to  quench my thirst for exploration into an amalgamation of a world of analytics  strategy and planning. During my time in Deloitte, I worked on end-to-end  validation processes for softwares for pharmaceutical clients. Also, my ongoing  post-graduation in MBA analytics has taken me closer to the field of analytics  in business. To fuel my constant need to take responsibilities, I am a member of  the media and public relations committee of our college. It lets me be a part of  the team who plans to create and apply for a promotion and PR strategies for  the college. I also handle the social media pages of the college. I have been a  content writer and editor for college related activities since graduation. I  love interacting with people and understanding them. The fact that IIM  beside you has a positive attitude towards mental health issues is  really an amazing thing. The company's very idea of trying to understand real  emotions, my increasing affinity towards analytics, my experience in strategizing  as a consultant and my love for learning are the reasons why I want to join this  internship. Thank you!
