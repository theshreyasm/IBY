 Hello, I'm Sakshi. I come from Mumbai. I did my undergraduation in mass media  with specialization in advertising. I have completed two  certification courses. One was entrepreneurship course by Turnip and  second one was foundations of management by Google. Apart from that, when I'm not  busy doing college group projects and assignments, I keep myself busy doing  various things like drawing, painting, singing, writing movie reviews on my  personal movie review account on Instagram. I also recently won an  international art competition hosted by the largest science channel on YouTube  called Krezkazad. They have over 19 million followers and it is one of my  biggest proudest achievements. Because I would like to spread  awareness about mental health issues and neurodevelopmental disorders, I have an  idea to share with you all. The idea goes as we get the AI to analyze what works  and what doesn't work for students with neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD  and then coming up with a program or strategy or a plan to help these  students out through specialized programs with maybe teachers who have a certain  teaching style that just works well for kids like these and or  activities that help them stay focused or concentrate better. That's it. Thank you.
