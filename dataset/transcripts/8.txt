 Hi, hope you're doing well. I'm Srivats Biyani. I am a PGP finance student at IIM Co-Ecode.  Now before joining IIM Co-Ecode, what all have I done? I am a chartered accountant and  I've also cleared CFA level 1. I interned with PWC for more than three years, did my  article shift basically from there and I worked in the statutory audit department. After clearing  CA, I worked with ITC limited in the internal audit department for almost 14 months after  which I joined IIM Co-Ecode for the MBA program. Now a little bit about my skills etc. So I  am a very analytical person. I love playing with numbers, you know, data sets, apply all  sorts of statistical tools, try and understand whatever possible outcomes or interpretations  are there from those numbers. I just love the idea about getting into the edtech space.  Education is something which I believe is the base or the source or basically just the  crux of any economy of the whole, not only the nation, of the whole world. If everyone  is educated, I think the whole problem, I think the major problem will be solved. So  this is the reason I am very fascinated about the idea that your company is providing and  I wish I will be able to expand the successful model that you've built in Japan and bring  that to India as well. So that is what I will aim to do if I am given an opportunity  to work with you. Thank you.
